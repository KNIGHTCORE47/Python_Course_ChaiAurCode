***Scopes and Closures in Python***

Scopes are also know as Namespaces

NOTE - Scopes/Namespaces
        01. Global Scope
        02. Local Scope

## In python, usage of scopes mainly focuses over function defination.

*** Global Scope:
    - Defined outside of the function

*** Local Scope:
    - Define inside of the function



*** If a variable define at the global scope, any function can access that reference value inside.

*** If a Parent function has other Child functions inside, according to the Local Scope if any varible derfine inside of Parent function, Child functions can access that reference values as well.


*** But Child functions can not access there local scoped reference values with each other.
