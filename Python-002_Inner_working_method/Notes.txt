*** PYTHON | cpython ***



--Python Inner Working Method--

//NOTE - After installation of python in your local machine along with the language python install also python interpreter and python virtual machine.


0. Python Interpreter => Script/Code file


1. index.py or etc.py [PY_Code] => Mostly Hidden [Byte_Code] => Python Virtual Machine [Python_VM]|


1.a. Initially python interpreter run any py script/py code compiles(Technical term) into Byte codes(LOW LEVEL CODE and not MACHINE CODE).


1.b. Byte codes run faster than script. Byte code example: abc.cpython-314.pyc . Byte codes are low lavel code that is why this codes can be run inside any machine which has installed Python_VM. That is why python is one of the first language choices for cloude services. 


1.c. this .pyc as Byte_Code is also called compiled python or FROZEN_BINARIES


1.d. FROZEN_BINARIES => Python_VM


2. __pycache__ ,
